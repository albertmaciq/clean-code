# Clean code
Code and attachments for our clean code.

>## What is Clean code?
>``Dirty code:`` if you have to think about it a lot to understand what it does.
>
>``Needs:`` a vast majority of time is spent reading and understanding code.
>
> [!IMPORTANT]
> It's not about whether code works or not. Instead, it's about whether code 
> is easy to read and understand.

>#### - First attempt
>Just with a few changes in variable naming we can acquire a better understandable code.
>That simple change makes our code cleaner, easier to read and to understand.
>
>#### - Second attempt
>Creating a class with good names and with all the validation logic baked into the class.
>
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Like in programming there will not be a single right way of writing clean code.
>
> ***To sump up Clean Code is readable and understandable. And therefore, code which is
> readable and meaningful, which reduces the cognitive load you have to go through.***
> 
>  [!NOTE]
> **Clean Code SHOULD:**
> - be concise,
> - be fun to write and to maintain,
> - avoid unintuitive names, complex nesting and big code blocks,
> - follow common best practices and patterns.

>## Key Pain Points
> - **Names:** variables, functions, classes.
> - **Structure & comments:** code formatting, good & bad comments (how comments and too many
> comments could actually lead to dirty code instead of improving it).
> - **Functions:** length, parameters.
> - **Conditionals & Error Handling:** deep nesting, missing error handling.
> - **Classes & Data Structures:** missing distinction, bloated classes.

> [!WARNING]
> 
> **Clean Code** --> write code which is readable & easy to understand 
> (how to write code) (focus on single problems / files).
>             
> **Patterns & Principles** --> write code which is maintainable and extensible.
> 
> **Clean Architecture** --> where to write which code (focus on the project as a whole).
