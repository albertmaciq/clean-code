# Clean code
Code and attachments for our clean code.

## What is Clean code?
``Dirty code:`` if you have to think about it a lot to understand what it does.

``Needs:`` a vast majority of time is spent reading and understanding code.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It's not about whether code works or not. Instead, it's about whether code 
> is easy to read and understand.

### intro package

#### - First attempt
Just with a few changes in variable naming we can acquire a better understandable code.
That simple change makes our code cleaner, easier to read and to understand.

#### - Second attempt
Creating a class with good names and with all the validation logic baked into the class.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Like in programming there will not be a single right way of writing clean code.

> [!NOTE]
> ***To sump up Clean Code is readable and understandable. And therefore, code which is
> readable and meaningful, which reduces the cognitive load you have to go through.***
> 
> Clean Code should:
> - be concise,
> - be fun to write and to maintain,
> - avoid unintuitive names, complex nesting and big code blocks,
> - follow common best practices and patterns.
